added a scanner so all you have to do is input the current battery charge and distance when prompted, don't have to directly edit code unless you want to change something 
will tell you: 
power the panels will produce at distance
charge time based on current capacity
battery capacity and time it would take to reach distance
power/meter
total consumption
range (a little bugged bc it can't go very far on full draw, if you put 0 it will tell you range on full battery)
